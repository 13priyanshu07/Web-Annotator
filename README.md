# Web-Annotator

## A chrome extension for highlighting text on a webpage.

This chrome extension allows the user to highlight text on web-pages with following features:

1. Color-select: User can select any color for the highlight on any webpage.
2. Add-notes: Ablility to add notes to the highlighted content.
3. Persistance: All the annotations are saved in an Annotations list in the chrome local storage. Whenever we reload the page it will highlight the text on its own.
(This feature wouldn't work if you highlight a hyperlink on any webpage. But it will still store the annotations in the list.)
4. Search: Enables the user to search for any annotations made based on the criteria of note, highlighted-content and date.
5. Shortcut: The user can press Ctrl+Shift+Z to remove the most recent highlight.
6. Export: the user can export the data of the webpage along with the highlighted text and their corresponding notes.
